### "Like A Boss"

Your challenge *today* is to inspect the
[**DOM**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
of in the `20150922/index.html` page and write a function to *find* the article title containing the word "Boss".

Start the static server `npm start` and then visit: http://localhost:8000/archive/20150922/

You should expect to see something like this in your browser:

Now open the file: `archive/20150922/index.html` in your `editor` and
write the `findTitleContainingWord()` function that passes the test!


If the *challenge* is unclear, *ask* for clarification: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/morning-challenge/issues
If the *solution* is not apparent to you, dust off your google/teamwork skills!
