# 10th November Morning challenge

From Nikhila Ravi

## Arrow Functions in ES6

1. Clone Jack's es6-playground repo:

https://github.com/jrans/es6-playground

2. ```npm install```

3. ```npm install -g babel-cli```

4. Add the arrowfuncs.js file from this repo

5. ```npm install tape```

6. Run the tests: ```babel-node arrowfuncs.js```

7. Make all 4 tests pass!

Some of them might pass already, but the challenge is to rewrite the functions with arrow functions so the tests still pass.
